# ft_transcendence

The ft_transcendence project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest. The website will allow users to play Pong with others in real-time multiplayer online games. The project requires a nice user interface. The use of libraries or frameworks to replace the job is strictly prohibited, and any tools or resources utilized must be justified.
